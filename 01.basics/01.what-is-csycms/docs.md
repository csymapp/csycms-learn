CSYCMS is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based content management system,knowlwdge base and static site generator for nodejs. It uses static Markdown files to serve the content which are pulled from public/private repos in github. bitcket, gitlab or any other git repository management services. It runs services that enables it to auto update itself and the content it serves. It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, and allows you to use the structure of content files used in the [most popular flat file cms](https://getgrav.org) but in nodejs. 


The name **CSYCMS** is just a shortened version of **CSyber Systems Content Management System**. If you ever need to pronounce that word please keep the first `C` silent so that you pronounce it as `sigh CMS`

The underlying architecture of CSYCMS is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [Hogan Templating](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/): for powerful control of the user interface

## CSYCMS' Place in the Universe

There are many powerful open source CMS solutions for building complex websites.  Some of the more commonly used ones are [Joomla](http://joomla.org), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), and [Drupal](http://drupal.org). The downside of these platforms is that they have a steep learning curve associated with them. This requires a significant amount of your time - and this may be the time that you do not have when creating a website is not your main job.

These platforms provide a wealth of features and functionality that you can extend with a wide variety of open source and proprietary plug-ins and themes.  These extensions and themes are themselves often feature-packed, requiring more knowledge and time on the part of the developer yet. In the end, you often find yourself creating a website that requires many plugins and extensions from many different vendors. This can make your design overly complicated and difficult to maintain over the long term.

CSYCMS tackles the problem differently.  It focuses primarily on your content and turns your content structure into a navigable site. This make it easy for developers, engineers, etc to write documentations for their work, creating a knowledge base that can be referred to in after years by them or by others who take up their positions. This is what CSYCMS is designed to do. How easy is it? As easy as writing a `README.md` for github, gitlab, etc..

That it is written in nodejs means that further work can be done in it to bring it up to the level of other complex CMSes written in other languages

It installation process is simple and it's update process even simpler, being automated. To get a basic site up-and-running requires minimal Web development experience. To create content for the site requires only a knowledge of markdown.
