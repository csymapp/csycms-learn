## Routing
As we already described in the opening [basics -> Folders section](/basics/Folder%20Structure), **routing** in CSYCMS is primarily controlled by the folder structure you use when you build your site content.

The route is derived from the location of the file requested. For example

`/basics/content`

would point to

`content/thissite/0*.basics/0*.content/chapter.md`

or

`content/thissite/0*.basics/0*.content/docs.md`
